 These data relate to number of referrals rather than number of individuals. Where people are referred to more than one service, they have more than one referral.

The principal data source for general acute inpatient & day case stays is the SMR01 dataset. The count and rates presented in this indicator do not include attendance resulting in A&E attendance only. Each individual patient may have more than one stay and hence the number of people discharged within a year will be less than the total number of stays. When figures are broken down by geographical area and age the numbers in some categories can be very small; this indicator therefore uses a combined and averaged three-year period to ensure reasonably robust estimates for small areas. 
 
 Up to six diagnoses are recorded per admission, and episodes with either a main or a supplementary diagnosis of alcohol misuse are included. 
 
 Note that some caution is necessary when using these data, as alcohol misuse may only be suspected and may not always be recorded by the hospital. The figures presented here are based on all alcohol-related diagnoses throughout the hospital stay and will reflect prevalence in the catchment area as well as local policy with regard to hospital admission and discharge. For this indicator the discharge date refers to the end of the patient’s continuous hospital stay, which can be made up of a number of records depending if the patient has been transferred from one hospital to another or from one specialty to another during the stay.

These figures include the crimes of Threatening and Abusive Behaviour and Breach of the Peace. Breach of the Peace is differentiated from Threatenign and Abusive Behaviour in that it must ""threaten serious disturbance to the community"", whereas Threatening and Abusive Behaviour does not require a public element.

The [Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018](https://www.gov.scot/publications/recorded-crime-scotland-2023-24/pages/19/), which was enacted in 2019/20, specified that where offenses that historically constituted Breach of the Peace formed part of a domestic abuse incident, they should be recorded under the new offense of Domestic Abuse.

  a) in receipt of out-of-work benefits (Income Support (IS), Income-Based Jobseekers Allowance (JSA), Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) and Pension Credit (PC)) 
  or
  b) has a reported income less than 60 per cent of national median income (identified through receipt of Child Tax Credits).
  
  The total number of children in any given area is produced using Child Benefit data held by HMRC, typically covering around 96 per cent of all children in the UK. From January 2013, if a claimant of Child Benefit or their partner has an individual income of more than £50,000 per year, they are liable to repay some or all of their Child Benefit due to the introduction of the High Income Child Benefit charge. Claimants affected by the High Income Child Benefit charge have the option to opt-out of receiving Child Benefit. Therefore, the total number of children used in this publication includes numbers for claimants that have opted out of receiving Child Benefit, and the children that they are responsible for. This means that the measure may not be as complete as it has been previously due to families with higher incomes no longer claiming Child benefit.
  
  All of the estimates are independently rounded to the nearest 5, therefore aggregating the individual estimates may not sum to the given totals for an area. The estimates are based on the finalised awards tax credits data, and as such are derived from a full set of administrative records rather than a sample. From this data the “sub-period” of the award that spanned the 31st August is selected.

A suicide is defined as a death resulting from intentional self-harm or undetermined intent. The data comprises suicides occurring in Scotland registered by the National Records of Scotland (NRS). This includes a small proportion of deaths for persons who were not resident in Scotland, who are assigned to their place of death instead, and excludes deaths of residents of Scotland occurring outwith Scotland. Deaths data are analysed by date of registration of death rather than date of death. They will be updated when the 2023 data become available. Published estimates are 5-year rolling averages to allow sufficient counts to enable calculation and comparisons of rates split by gender and SIMD quintile.

In 2011, NRS changed its coding practice with some deaths previously coded under 'mental and behavioural disorders' now being classed as 'self-poisoning of undetermined intent' and consequently as undetermined intent suicides. This indicator presents data based on the new coding rule only; this combined with the need to aggregate over years results in the lack of trend data being available.

A 'co-dependency' substance type was introduced for cases where the referral relates to treatment for problematic use of both alcohol and drugs. Previously in DATWT, such cases would have been allocated to either ’alcohol’ or ‘drug’ depending on the substance considered the dominant issue. These data relate to number of referrals rather than number of individuals. Where people are referred to more than one service, they have more than one referral. Data includes referrals to community-based and hospital-based services (referrals to prison-based services are excluded). ADPs have the responsibility of ensuring the submission of accurate and up-to-date information by treatment services. To this end, each quarter ADPs are asked to check and confirm the data for their area. If an ADP is unable to confirm the data for a service, then the service is excluded from the data (both for the period of non-submission and all other periods). Two Ten (of 204) services have been excluded from this release as they were unable to confirm their data for at least one quarter up to the end of the 2022/23 financial year.

  Fuel Poverty is defined in terms of the ratio between the cost of the energy required to maintain an adequate standard of warmth and other uses of energy in the home, and the income of the household occupying the dwelling. When this ratio exceeds 0.1, the household is considered to be fuel poor. In other words, a fuel poor household would be required to spend more than 10% of its income on all household fuel use.

For the NHS Board and local authority, LE is calculated over three-year time periods, in line with the NRS publication. For the intermediate zones due to the severe instability of the small numbers, LE is calculated over five-year periods. Please note that the data points indicated on a time trend charts represent mid-point within the three or five-year period depending on selected geography level. That is, for the NHS board and local authority showed year 2011 represents the mid-point for 2010-2012 period, while for intermediate zone it represents 2009-2013 period. 
 
To avoid the least robust situations for the intermediate zones, LE for an area is not calculated where: the five-year total population for that sex was less than 5,000 people; and/or there were fewer than 40 deaths for that sex over the 5-year period.
For a small number of intermediate zones LE could not be calculated because an age group had a zero population estimate or no deaths had occurred in the oldest (85+ years) age group. This means some extreme LE estimates are omitted from the full range for intermediate geographies within Scotland.  Over the time period 2009-13, amongst the remaining data for intermediate geographies, LE at birth ranged from 58.4 to 92.0 years for males, and from 70.3 to 94.4 years for females.
 
Please note that some of these data have large 95% confidence intervals (up to 14 or 12 years). The implications of this are best explained using an example. The lowest remaining male LE at birth (58.4 years) has a confidence interval of 8.0 years, from 54.4 to 62.4 years. This means that there is a 1 in 20 chance that the true LE at birth lies either below 54.4 years or above 62.4 years (although the most likely true value remains at 58.4 years). The wide range of possible values indicates that further caution is required in drawing conclusions about the apparent ranking of small areas.","[Life expectancy in Scotland, 2021-2023](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/publications/life-expectancy-in-scotland-2021-2023/#)",NA,"Jul-2025","Oct-2025","Higher numbers are better","H","NRS provide source data for Scotland, NHS Board and LA.

  The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), developed by researchers at the Universities of Warwick and Edinburgh, is a tool for measuring mental wellbeing at a population level. It comprises 14 positively worded statements that relate to an individual’s state of mental wellbeing. Added to the SALSUS in 2010, pupils were asked to indicate how often they have had such thoughts and feelings over the last two weeks. Each statement has a five item scale ranging from '1 - None of the time' to '5 - All of the time'. The lowest possible score is therefore 14 and the highest is 70.
  
  Numerators are not presented in the spine chart; this is due to the relatively small number of people, when compared to the population, being included in the survey.
  Weighting has been used to correct for any effects of non-response to ensure that the results are representative on various characteristics of the target population.
  The sample design of SALSUS is complex, involving stratification by local authority and school type (state or independent) as well as clustering within schools. Clustering reduces the precision of estimates compared with a simple random sample, whereas stratification can increase precision. Weighting can also reduce the precision of estimates. These factors can impact on the reliability of the confidence intervals presented here; this should be taken into consideration when interpreting this indicator.

There are also potential mode effects (respondents answering differently over the telephone than they would face-to-face) and seasonal effects (the telephone survey took place during October 2020 and January to March 2021, whereas SHS face-to-face surveys normally run throughout the year).

A suicide is defined as a death resulting from intentional self-harm or undetermined intent. The data comprises suicides occurring in Scotland registered by the National Records of Scotland (NRS). This includes a small proportion of deaths for persons who were not resident in Scotland, who are assigned to their place of death instead, and excludes deaths of residents of Scotland occurring outwith Scotland. Deaths data are analysed by date of registration of death rather than date of death. Published estimates are 5-year rolling averages to allow sufficient counts to enable calculation and comparisons of rates split by gender and SIMD quintile. 

In 2011, NRS changed its coding practice with some deaths previously coded under 'mental and behavioural disorders' now being classed as 'self-poisoning of undetermined intent' and consequently as undetermined intent suicides.

For each of the 12 questions one point is given if the participant responded 'more than usual' or 'much more than usual'. Scores are then totalled to create an overall score of zero to twelve. A score of four or more (described as a high GHQ-12 score) is indicative of a potential psychiatric disorder. Conversely a score of zero is indicative of psychological wellbeing.

"Children subject to child protection inter-agency referral discussions","CYP Mental Health","Strutural","Number of children aged 17 years or under per 1,000 subject to interagency referral discussions. An IRD is a formal process used to address concerns about a child's safety and well-being. It involves sharing information and making decisions between key agencies like social work, police, and health services. The IRD is initiated when one of these agencies receives information suggesting a child may be experiencing or at risk of significant harm.  Therefore, an IRD is the first stage in formal child protection proceedings where young people may be at risk of harm or abuse.","Scottish Government (Childrens Social Work Statistics)",NA,"N/A","Number of inter-agency referral discussions (IRDs)","Total number of children aged under 18 years","Crude rate per 10,000 population (0-17 years)","cr","Already suppressed by data supplier","N",0,"None","Under 18","All","Financial year","2023/24","Single year","Annual","Council area, Health board, HSC partnership, Alcohol & drug partnership, Scotland","Byar's approximation","A child may be subject to more than one IRD in one year.
